\textbf{How to generate and print this PDF yourself}

\vspace*{.5cm}

\footnotesize

I can't resist showing you how to create the PDF for \emph{The Metropolitan Man} yourself. 
The following two pages show the code that produced this 
PDF\footnote{ \tiny{Actually the code that produced this PDF --- \texttt{build.py} --- is slightly more complicated
because it fixes some minor typesetting bugs in hyphenation and quotation marks.}}. 
By running it in your terminal with \texttt{python3 build.py}, the code will
download the \emph{The Metropolitan Man} from \url{fanfiction.net} 
and typeset it into a PDF with LaTeX (a typesetting program common in academia).

The code lives at this GitHub repository:

\noindent \url{https://github.com/justinpearson/The-Metropolitan-Man-Book}

Armed with the PDF and some cover art, you can then order a physical copy to be printed by 
an online book-printer like \url{http://lulu.com}.

I hope you can tweak this code and use it to download, typeset, 
and print your own books!

\noindent The script has four stages:

\begin{description}

\item[Download.] We use the Selenium Webdriver browser automation tool\footnote{
    \tiny{ \url{https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/} }
} to programatically drive the Firefox web browser to fanfiction.net to
download the HTML of each of the story's 13 chapters. Originally (Apr 2019),
I used the simpler command-line tool \texttt{curl}, but currently (Sep 2021) fanfiction.net
has a captcha system that detects and rejects requests from non-browser web scraping tools.
Surprisingly, the captcha even detects a re-used automated browser session,
so you have to tear down and re-initialize the browser each iteration.

\item[Parse HTML.] We use BeautifulSoup\footnote{
    \tiny{ \url{https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/} }
}, a Python HTML-parsing library,
to extract the text of each chapter from its scraped HTML webpage.
We extract both the chapter title and the HTML \texttt{<div>} tag containing
the chapter's text contents. We embed the chapter title in an \texttt{<h1>} header tag
and prepend it to the story's \texttt{<div>}, because pandoc --- used later in the pipeline --- 
converts header tags to \LaTeX\ chapters. 

\item[HTML to TeX.] We use Pandoc\footnote{\tiny{\url{https://pandoc.org/}}} to convert
each chapter's HTML to TeX format, converting all double-quote characters to ``smart quotes''.

\item[Assemble chapters.] We concatenate the TeX code of the 13 chapters, bookending them with a
LaTeX preamble and a footer, saving the result as \texttt{mm.tex}. Interestingly, the header file (\texttt{header.tex})
contains a LaTeX command to inject the source code of \texttt{build-simple.py} into the final tex file! How meta.

\item[TeX to PDF.] We use the \LaTeX\ document preparation system (installed via MacTeX\footnote{
    \tiny{ \url{http://tug.org/mactex/} }
}) to build the final PDF, \texttt{mm.pdf}. We run it twice, since the first run does not
generate the table of contents.
